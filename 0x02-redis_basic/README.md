# Redis NoSQL data storage application

- exercise.py: contains a Python script that creates a Cache class.
- exercise.py: contains a Python script that updates the previous task where Redis only allows to store string, bytes and numbers (and lists thereof). Whatever is stored as single elements will be returned as a byte string.
- exercise.py: contains a Python script that updates the previous task where we will implement a system to count how many times methods of the Cache class are called.
- exercise.py: contains a Python script that updates the previous task with a call_history decorator to store the history of inputs and outputs for a particular function.
- exercise.py: contains a Python script that updates the previous task by implementing a replay function to display the history of calls of a particular function.
- web.py: contains a Python script that implements a get_page function (prototype: def get_page(url: str) -> str:). The core of the function uses the requests module to obtain the HTML content of a particular URL and returns it.
